* Objectoplasm, an Object System Distribution written in Python 3
** DESIGN GOALS
 - A somewhat *simple* server implementation of a sane *subset* of the spec.
 - Server code should be *readable* in one go and be *contained in one file*.
 - Less classes and more functions. I.e. *function-driven* implementation
   rather than class-driven like in Objectoplex.
 - Utilizing ~asyncio~ natively. Probably with the help of the ~ohneio~
   library.
 - Library to implement Object System services in and a sample echo service.
** HOW TO HACK
 - ~virtualenv --python=python3 env~
 - ~source env/bin/activate~
 - ~pip install -r requirements.txt~
 - ~python objectoplasm.py~
 - Happy hacking!
** HOW TO RUN TEST SCRIPT
 - ~python3 test.py~
 - This should not require any libraries apart from Python 3 (I develop with Python 3.4).
